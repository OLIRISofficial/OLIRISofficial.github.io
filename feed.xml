Today I Am Going To Talk About What I’ve Been Doing For The Last Couple Of Weeks And Show The Games’ Current Development State. So Let’s Begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tales-of-war&quot;&gt;Tales Of War&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First Up I Almost Finished Placement System Of The Game. I Set Up A Grid System With Godot’s In Engine 3D Tiles GridMap. Then I Added Boundary System That Changes Building’s Material Depending On If It’s Placeable Or Not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video SRC=&quot;/SRC/Video/Posts/Placement.mp4&quot; muted=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Re Factored The Selection System To Be More Efficient And Easy To Read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video SRC=&quot;/SRC/Video/Posts/Selection.mp4&quot; muted=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With The Re Factoring Process I Also Fixed A Bug In The UI. The Bug Was If You Clicked Somewhere Empty On The Panels It Would’ve De Select Everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Also Added Health System With Health Bars On Top Of Units And Buildings. It Still Lacks Design Tho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video SRC=&quot;/SRC/Video/Posts/HealthSystem.mp4&quot; muted=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tales-of-heroes&quot;&gt;Tales Of Heroes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I Started This Project 2 Weeks Ago So The Game Is In A Very Rough State. Please Keep That In Mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switching Between First Person To Third Person (Please Don’t Mind How The Cross-air Looks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video SRC=&quot;/SRC/Video/Posts/Camswitch.mp4&quot; muted=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Added Ability System Which Makes The Player Do Some Stuff Like Double Jumping, Sliding Left Or Right, Dashing Etc. You Can Active Them With Keyboard Or Pressing The Abilities Button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video SRC=&quot;/SRC/Video/Posts/Abilities.mp4&quot; muted=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Added Health System With A Health Bar. It Also Lacks Design Too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video SRC=&quot;/SRC/Video/Posts/HealthHereos.mp4&quot; muted=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Actually That Was All The Things That I Did For Tales Of Heroes This Week. Hopefully Next Week Will Be More Productive Than This Week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-have-to-do-this-week&quot;&gt;What I Have To Do This Week&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tales-of-war-1&quot;&gt;Tales Of War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fog Of War&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repairing System&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3D Assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tales-of-heroes-1&quot;&gt;Tales Of Heroes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add Rotation To Third Person Mode&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Requirement System For Abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Writing. That’s The Only Part Of The Game That Needs To Be Done ASAP. Because Game Lacks The Story I Don’t Know What To Do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UI (Especially An Cross-air Texture)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3D Assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-stuff&quot;&gt;Other Stuff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I Also Have To Some Pages About The Games.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And This Month’s Game For Patreon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And That Was All. Thank You For Reading I Hope To See You Next Time With More Updates On The Games.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Welcome Back To OLIRIS .

This Is Me The Creator Of This Site And In This Post I Would Like To Share My Thoughts On My Journey Of Creating &lt;span class=&quot;Logo&quot;&gt;OLIRIS &lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-sixth-of-june&quot;&gt;Why Sixth Of June?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s Actually My Birthday. I Initially Planned On Launching This Site On 6.6.2019 But There Were Some Inconveniences Along The Way. (BTW This Makes &lt;span class=&quot;Logo&quot;&gt;OLIRIS &lt;/span&gt; A Gemini)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-were-the-inconveniences&quot;&gt;What Were The Inconveniences?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Starters My Files Got Corrupted And I Am Actually Doing All Of This In An Old Laptop With 32gb Of Flash Disk Which Void Linux Installed On It. Since I Broke The Bank I Can’t Update It.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-i-came-up-with-the-name&quot;&gt;How Did I Came Up With The Name?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Didn’t Want My Own Name To Be On The Internet So In The Middle Of The Night Of A 2014 Summer Day I Searched The Web For Name Generators. And In One Of Them I Randomly Found Osiris. However After A Little Search On Google I Realized That I Need To Edit It A Little Bit In Order To Be Unique So I Decided To Call My Online Presence &lt;span class=&quot;Logo&quot;&gt;OLIRIS &lt;/span&gt;. Before Going Public I At Least Created 20 Logos And Still Not Happy With This Version. (Sorry I Can’t Show The Rest Of The Logos For Now Hopefully In The Future I Can Recover My Files And Share Them With You)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-i-come-up-with-the-idea-of-creating-a-game-every-month&quot;&gt;How Did I Come Up With The Idea Of Creating A Game Every Month?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At First I Wanted To Open A Patreon Page For Myself To Be Completely Free And Independent. I Searched The Web For What I Can Do For My Patrons And Found Sokpop Collective Which Also Creates Games Every Month. That Idea Of Creating Games Every Month Was Fantastic For Me Because I Wanted To Improve Myself,Create Games That Are Not Connected To The Main &lt;span class=&quot;Logo&quot;&gt;OLIRIS &lt;/span&gt;-ian Storyline And Have Distinctive Art Style. But I Would Sound Like An Idea Thief If I Don’t Make Anything Original. So I Decided To Deliver My Weekly Devlogs A Day Before Of The Publish Date And For My Monthly Games’ Devlogs  Publish Them On Patreon So Only My Patrons Can Read Them. Write Postmortems For All Of My Games But Publish Them On Patreon. Make Discounts For My Games. Create Exclusive In-game Content For My Patrons And These Are Not All. In The Future I Am Planning On Making More Stuff For My Patrons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-am-going-to-do-in-the-future&quot;&gt;What I Am Going To Do In The Future?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Am Going To Continue On Finishing This Site That’s My Main Goal For Now, Finish What I Am Currently Working On, Create More Games To Continue The Storyline, Improve Myself In Different Areas Of Tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-not-use-any-images-on-your-blog-posts&quot;&gt;Why Do You Not Use Any Images On Your Blog Posts?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Am Actually Working On That Probably In The Future My Posts Will Be Updated With Images,Gifs,Videos And Other Resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-this-all&quot;&gt;Is This All?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No But For Now Yeah See You Next Time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Welcome To OLIRIS Everyone. This Is Me The Creator Of This Site And In This Post I Would Like To Share My Thoughts On My Journey Of Creating OLIRIS .</summary></entry></feed>
